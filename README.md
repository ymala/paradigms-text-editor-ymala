## Project Evolution: Text Editor Across Paradigms

This project evolved through three major phases, each deepening understanding of programming paradigms:

1. **Procedural Implementation**  
   - Built editor using structured programming with functions and global state.
   - Focused on core features: file I/O, text input/output, and basic editing flow.
   - Gave clarity on step-by-step control flow and imperative code structure.

2. **Object-Oriented Refactoring**  
   - Refactored code into classes encapsulating editor components (e.g., buffer, cursor, command handlers).
   - Improved modularity, encapsulation, and separation of concerns.
   - Demonstrated how OOP enables cleaner code organization, easier maintenance, and extensibility.

3. **Using a Third-Party Library for Caesar Cipher**  
   - Implemented text encryption/decryption using an external library instead of a custom algorithm.  
   - Demonstrated how leveraging existing solutions can simplify implementation, ensure reliability, and keep focus on integrating functionality rather than reinventing it.  
   - Reinforced understanding of modular design and code reuse.

**Learning Outcome:**  
Through these stages, I developed a solid grasp of programming paradigms—from procedural flow to OOP principles and modular design—illustrating an intentional progression toward cleaner, more maintainable, and extensible code.
